# Intro

- It works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Even on your phone
- It can be **self-hosted**

## The issue with Microsft Remote Desktop solution

The computer we use to remote into another computer can be Windows Home, but the computer you're remoting into has to run Windows Pro.  
Microsoft native RDP software is fairly limited, it doesn't allow to remote access a computer from anywhere, only from the same network.  

## Why not use TeamViewer or Anydesk?

Because these solutions can't be self-hosted, you need to use their servers. Do you trust them enough for that?
